Installation Guide

1. Install Cocotb
 - pip install Cocotb

2. Install Icarus verilog
 - https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Installation_Guide
 - Cadence Xcelium should also work with Cocotb, but due to some reason Cocotb cannot find Python3 packages in venv on ECE clusters. All tests are done locally for now.

3. Run tests
 - In terminal: > make


User Guide

1. Change target test module
 - Change FILENAME and TOPLEVEL in Makefile. Be sure to uncomment "include"s in the target module. They were commented out to avoid duplicate instantiation error in Verilog. 

2. Parameter
 - COMPILE_ARGS += -P<module_name>.<PARAMETER_NAME>=<NEW_VALUE / variable>

3. How do I tell if the simulation returns no error?
 - The simulation works by checking the assertion between the golden result and the actual result. If no assertion error returns, and a "PASS" shows on the right under PASS/FAIL, then the simulation completes with no assertion error.

4. File tree structure
 - src/ : All Verilog source codes.
 - sim/ : All Python testbenches. All testbenches are named <target_module_name>_test.py
 - sim_result/ : copy of simulation results

5. Git
 - https://github.com/qiufengtiger/FPGA-chip-design
 - Run > sh GitUpdate.sh to only update necessary src files to Git.
